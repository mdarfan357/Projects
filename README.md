# Projects
These projects were done by me during my time in college to better understand the topic taught in college.

Some of them are games that can be made easily in python. I have added an AI to these games so be sure to check them out.
(my apologies for the messy code)

To run these games you just need some basic python modules and python 3.9 that's what i am using currently.
